ATTRIBUTION THEORY : by understanding past behavior, we can protect ourselves and predict future behavior Dispositional attribution: interprets behavior as reflecting a person’s stable, internal characteristics Situational attribution: interprets behavior as reflecting external forces acting on the person Correspondent inference theory: people make dispositional attribution when actions have unique effects, low in assumed desirability Military vs. peace corps study: Assumed desirability: whether population is assumed to have behavior Attributional biases: limitations on cognitive processes, motivation to appear good and feel in control Fundamental attribution error: bias for making dispositional rather than situational attributions about others’ behavior FAE Actor study: high school students read neutral actor bio, saw portray friendly vs. mean, then reported actor to have traits of act Actor observer effect: explains our own behavior, biased towards situational attributions Video tape conversation study: 2 actors 2 observers, then actors watched recordings from own/partner’s/no perspective Same perspective => situation attributions to self/dispositional attributions to others, partner perspective => flip Self enhancement: desire to view oneself positively (motivations in attribution theory) Social perceptiveness study: test, then told either better or worse than 80%, success credit social perceptiveness, fail blamed luck Consistency: desires to avoid contradiction between one’s beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors Self-serving bias: tendency to make dispositional attributions about one’s own success and situational about failure Although we tend to make dispositional attributions about others (FAE) , we tend to make situational attributions about the self (actor-observer effect) unless making a dispositional attribution about the self would make us feeld good about ourselves ( self serving bias) Egocentric bias: rely to heavily on self/view self as better, Better than average bias: view as better than average False consensus effect: belief that everyone thinks something, false uniqueness effect: belief that self is unique Self handicapping: behaviors designed to sabotage one’s own performance in order to provide excuse for failure Drugs and intellectual study: impossible vs. normal test, told good performance vs. not, then asked to take facilitate vs. inhibit drug Impossible test/good performance => inhibit drug => self-handicap GROUP BEHAVIOR: Roles: shared expectations in a group about how particular people are supposed to behave Instrumental role: helps group achieve its tasks, Expressive role: provides emotional support and maintain morale Groupes thrive when roles match each member’s skills, role ambiguity and job performance negatively correlate Norms: rules of conduct for members (can be formal vs. informal, implicit vs. explicit) Homogeneity: perceived similarity has greater punishment of deviation, Heterogeneity: perceived dissimilarity has less punishment Tolerance for norm deviance study: question highlighting similarity vs. difference, asked to evaluate common/uncommon view Highlighted similarity offered more tolerance for typical, less tolerance for atypical view Cohesiveness: forces exerted on a group to push members closer together and promote mutual liking (often leads to better group performance) High cohesiveness => feel committed to group tasks, like other group members, feel pride, engage in many/intense group activities Social facilitation: effect other people have on performance by mere presence of others Facilitation: better in presence of others, Inhibition: worse in presence of others Reasons: Zajonc’s mere presence theory: resence of others is sufficient to produce arousal => facilitation of dominant response, Evaluation apprehension theory : only occurs when someone is in position to evaluate performance, distraction conflict theory: presence of others divides attention => unsure of what to attend to => arousal => dominant response Zajonc’s solution: presence of another person/member of same species increases arousal, which strengthens dominant response Easy task => performance enhancement, Difficult task => performance impairment Yerkes-Dodson Law: relationship of arousal vs. performance is bell curve Social loafing: group produced reduction in individual output on easy tasks in which contributions are pooled Group applause study: participants clapped/cheered alone vs. in groups, individual sound decreased as group size increased Less likely to occur when: believe that performances can be identified/evauluated, task is highly important/meaningful, belief that efforts are necessary to successful outcome, expectation of punishment for poor performance, small/cohesive group Collective effort model : indivudials try hard to the point that they believe individual effort is important Deindividuation: loss of person’s sense of individuality and reduction of normal constraints against deviant behavior (reduced introspection) Attentional cues: focus person’s attention away from self, accountability cues: feeling like one is not personally accountable Halloween candy study: alone vs. group (accountability), anonymous vs. not => group anonymous stole candy, alone nonanon didn’t Process loss: group performance reduced by obstacles from groupwork, process gain: group performance increased where group outperforms individuals who compromise it Additive tasks: group product is sum of member contributions, conjunctive tasks: group product determined by meber with poorest performance, disjunctive tasks: group product determined by best performance Brainstorming: to increase production of creative ideas by encouraging group members to speak freely without criticism Drawbacks: production blocking, free riding, evaluation apprehension, performance matching Group polarization: exaggeration through group discussion of initial tendencies in group members Biased sampling : tendency for groups to spend more time discussing shared information than unshared information "
